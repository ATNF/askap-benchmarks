# Notes from 2022 GPU PACER Workshop
- CMake is needed.
- Error check macro for HIP?
- Degridding - GPU version fails in code verification
- CUDA versions will be changed into HIP.
- There are a few attempts on gpu kernel improvement for CLEAN and gridding kernels in CUDA, which will be tried here in HIP after the HIPification.
- Finding max and the related index in HIP (atomic reduction?)
