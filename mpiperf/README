This is a simple test program to be used to measure the performance of a filesystem. It uses a specific ASKAP workload and mimics the central processor frontend writing out a measurement set.

It is run like so:

mpirun -np 2 $ASKAP_ROOT/Code/Components/CP/benchmarks/current/msperf/apps/msperf -inputs config.in

This will start two writer processes, each executing per the configuration file passed to them. An example configuration file is provided below, which simulates the I/O from a 1 hour BETA (6 antenna) observation:

# Filename for the output files
msperf.filename         = testdata_%w.ms

# Storage manager configuration
msperf.stman.bucketsize = 2097152
msperf.stman.tilencorr  = 4
msperf.stman.tilenchan  = 32

# Integration time in seconds
msperf.integrationTime  = 5

# Number of channels per task
msperf.nChan            = 8192

msperf.nIntegrations    = 720
msperf.nAntenna         = 6
msperf.nFeeds           = 36
msperf.nPol             = 4
msperf.nFields          = 1



This will then run like so:

Creating dataset testdata_0.ms
Creating dataset testdata_1.ms
Wrote integration 0 in 1.03 seconds (4.85437x requirement)
Wrote integration 1 in 0.21 seconds (23.8095x requirement)
Wrote integration 2 in 2.23 seconds (2.24215x requirement)
Wrote integration 3 in 0.22 seconds (22.7273x requirement)
